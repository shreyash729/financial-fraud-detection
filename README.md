# Financial Fraud Detection Solution

## Overview
This project provides an AI-powered solution to detect and prevent financial fraud, focusing on spam call detection, deepfake VKYC fraud prevention, and transaction monitoring. The solution leverages AWS cloud services to provide real-time, scalable, and privacy-compliant fraud detection mechanisms.

## Features

1. **Spam Call Detection:**
   - Analyze call metadata and behavioral patterns to detect suspicious activities.
   - Utilize NLP techniques to analyze call transcripts for phishing and scam indicators.
   - Real-time call blocking and user alerts to mitigate risks.

2. **Deepfake VKYC Detection:**
   - Advanced computer vision and audio analysis to detect manipulated facial expressions and voice patterns.
   - Real-time differentiation between authentic and AI-generated inputs.

3. **Transaction Monitoring:**
   - Monitor transaction patterns to detect anomalies indicative of fraud or money laundering.
   - Ensure post-onboarding security through continuous analysis.

4. **User Feedback & Reporting:**
   - Enable users to report fraud and spam, improving the system via feedback loops.
   
## AWS Services Used
- **Amazon Connect:** For call handling and analysis.
- **Amazon Transcribe:** Convert voice to text for further NLP analysis.
- **Amazon Comprehend:** Analyze text for scam indicators.
- **Amazon Rekognition:** Deepfake detection via facial analysis.
- **AWS Lambda:** Serverless execution for real-time processing.
- **Amazon CloudWatch:** Monitoring and alerting.
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** Store fraud detection records.

## System Architecture
The solution follows a modular architecture:

1. Incoming call data -> Amazon Connect -> AWS Lambda (call analysis)
2. Call transcript -> Amazon Transcribe -> Amazon Comprehend
3. VKYC video -> Amazon Rekognition -> Fraud detection
4. Transaction data -> Machine Learning models for anomaly detection

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-fraud-detection.git
    cd financial-fraud-detection
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Deploy AWS infrastructure using CloudFormation:
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation deploy --template-file deployment/cloudformation_template.yaml --stack-name fraud-detection-stack
    ```

## Usage

1. Run spam call detection:
    ```python
    from src.spam_call_detection import detect_spam_call
    detect_spam_call("Your bank account is compromised, call now!")
    ```

2. Run deepfake detection:
    ```python
    from src.deepfake_detection_vkyc import detect_deepfake
    detect_deepfake("sample_video.mp4")
    ```

3. Monitor transactions:
    ```python
    from src.fraud_transaction_monitor import detect_fraudulent_transaction
    detect_fraudulent_transaction({"amount": 15000, "location": "Unknown"})
    ```
